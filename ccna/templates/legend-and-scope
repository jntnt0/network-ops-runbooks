# Legend and Scope (CCNA Ops Labs)

Legend:
- A = Fully demonstrable in a lab tool (PocketCLI, Packet Tracer, CML, EVE-NG, GNS3) with configs plus show outputs saved as text
- B = Demonstrable with higher-fidelity IOS XE images or multi-device labs (CML/EVE/GNS3) and deeper, more realistic behavior
- C = Mostly documentation and story pack only unless you have real enterprise gear or specific platforms (WLC, enterprise Wi-Fi, ISP handoff quirks)

Repo structure (recommended for CCNA):
- /runbooks
- /configs
- /evidence
- /diagrams
- /scripts (optional)
- /templates

## Standards

### Evidence standards (required)
Primary proof should be text, not screenshots.
- Save show outputs as .txt
- Save running-config snippets as .cfg (or .txt)
- Save change sets as fix-commands.txt
- Save topology diagrams as .png (or .svg)
- Screenshots are allowed, but only when they add value (topology view, UI-only features)

Evidence naming convention (required)
- Folder per scenario under /evidence:
  - /evidence/<scenario-slug>/
    - 01-topology.png
    - 02-before-show-<command>.txt
    - 03-before-running-config.cfg
    - 04-fix-commands.txt
    - 05-after-show-<command>.txt
    - 06-notes.md (optional)
- Use UTC timestamps inside notes when possible.
- If any artifact contains real identifiers, redact them and state what was redacted.

### Redaction rules (required)
Do not commit:
- Real public IPs you own or use
- Real company names, domains, hostnames, usernames
- Any credentials, keys, tokens
If you need to show an IP, use RFC 5737 examples (203.0.113.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 192.0.2.0/24) or RFC 1918 space.

### Runbook philosophy
Every runbook must:
- reproduce the failure (or describe how it would occur)
- show how to confirm the failure with specific show commands
- apply a minimal fix
- verify with specific show commands
- include rollback
- point to evidence artifacts

## Standard Runbook Template (required)
Use this exact structure for every runbook.

### A/B/C Tag
- Tag: (A|B|C)

### Symptoms
- What the user or monitoring sees
- What is broken (and what still works)

### Scope
- Devices involved (R1, SW1, etc.)
- Protocols involved (VLAN, STP, OSPF, etc.)

### Preconditions
